# Scripts

A collection of scripts I've been collecting, put together or tweaked to how I want them to work. The majority of these are not rocket science, I do not claim to be a master scripter! They just make some things I personally do a little easier!

**Scripts Overview:**

-**Up-or-down.sh -** This allows you to check a host/service/applictaion to see whether it is up or down. Connection intervals can be adjusted to suit.

-**GetSSLCert.sh -** This simplly connects to the target, gets the SSL cert, ditches the unnecessary stuff and displays the x509 info in a nice readbale format.

-**GoFetchIt.sh -** This script does a few things, basically a wrapper for a few tools. It resolves a user supplied host name, then runs Dig, Whois, grabs HTTP Headers and finally incorporates the functionality from GetSSLCert. Handy for Web Apps etc.
